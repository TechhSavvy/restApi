# RestApi Project

Sharing data to and from a real database, allowing the user to create and edit there post.

## Introduction

I'll build a rest api in which i'll get and post some kind of data from a database(sqlite3).

This data will then be connected to angular/cli framework and display data.

Both the restApl and framework will present something we developers know as the CRUD method.

## Purpose

Real purpose is that im tied of searching YouTube and google on how to, yes in some cases it's fine but I almost feel like I'm reliaing on these videos, what happen when they no longer exist.

PS: Would'nt know what ill be doing in life if not Web Development/ coding, maybe trying to figure how to buy and sell things.

## Deployment

I'm pretty sure you should have these tools install in other for thing to work currectly
